# Caniello Handoff

## Current State

- Active task: `spec/tasks/authenticated-app-shell-navigation.md`.
- Active branch: `codex/shape-app-dashboard-skeleton`.
- Current workflow: authenticated app shell navigation has been implemented and validated. It is ready for `forge-evaluator`; publish only after evaluation passes or the human explicitly requests publishing.

## Latest Notes

- The active harness is being simplified around `spec/roadmap.md`, `spec/features/`, `spec/tasks/`, and the Forge skills.
- Historical Flow Forge material is archived under `.codex/flow-forge-reference/` and remains available as reference.
- Durable product context now lives in `spec/product-context.md`.
- Old Flow Forge-era spec artifacts were archived under `spec/archive/flow-forge-history/` instead of deleted.
- Active guidance now points normal work to `spec/product-context.md`, `spec/roadmap.md`, lightweight feature briefs, task files, architecture notes or ADRs, validation, and handoff.
- Created feature brief `spec/features/authenticated-app-dashboard-skeleton.md` for the post-auth app dashboard and onboarding skeleton.
- Created task candidates:
  - `spec/tasks/authenticated-app-shell-navigation.md`
  - `spec/tasks/first-run-onboarding-skeleton.md`
  - `spec/tasks/home-dashboard-skeleton.md`
  - `spec/tasks/app-section-empty-states.md`
  - `spec/tasks/dashboard-skeleton-validation.md`
- Refined `spec/tasks/authenticated-app-shell-navigation.md` for implementation as a narrow authenticated shell/navigation task only: no dashboard cards, persistence, real search, real notifications, live assistant behavior, or sharing behavior.
- Created `forge-publisher` as the optional post-validation publishing skill for commit, push, and draft PR creation.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `spec/README.md` so the lightweight Forge flow ends with optional publishing after handoff.
- Added matching `agents/openai.yaml` UI metadata for all active Forge skills so `forge-publisher` is consistent with the rest of the skill set.
- Implemented `spec/tasks/authenticated-app-shell-navigation.md` in `apps/web/features/account/AccountApp.tsx` and `apps/web/features/account/content.ts`: signed-in `/app` now renders a localized shell with desktop side navigation, mobile horizontal fallback navigation, active Home state, inert search/pet/notification/account affordances, existing logout behavior, and a minimal non-card main content region. No dashboard cards, onboarding, persistence, live search, notifications, AI, sharing, or section routes were added.
- Added focused `AccountApp` coverage for authenticated shell labels, active Home navigation, protected-route behavior, and logout/session behavior.

## Changed Files

- `apps/web/features/account/AccountApp.tsx`
- `apps/web/features/account/AccountApp.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/features/account/content.ts`
- `spec/tasks/authenticated-app-shell-navigation.md`
- `spec/handoff.md`

Dirty worktree note:

- Untracked `.codex/skills/forge-weekly-reporter/` is present with `SKILL.md` and `agents/openai.yaml`; it appears unrelated to the authenticated app shell task and was not included as part of this handoff update.

## Validation Status

Current task validation for `spec/tasks/authenticated-app-shell-navigation.md`:

- `pnpm --filter web test -- AccountApp.test.tsx` passed outside the sandbox after the sandboxed command failed with `[ERROR] fetch failed`.
- `pnpm --filter web lint` passed outside the sandbox after the sandboxed command failed with `[ERROR] fetch failed`.
- `pnpm --filter web test` passed outside the sandbox; Vitest emitted existing localStorage experimental warnings.
- Browser validation used Playwright fallback because the in-app browser reported `Browser is not available: iab`.
- Started web app on `http://localhost:3001` because port 3000 was already in use.
- Playwright validation with seeded local account `akowalska@example.com` confirmed unauthenticated `/app` redirects to `/login?next=%2Fapp`, login returns to `/app`, Home has `aria-current="page"`, shell labels and top-bar affordances render, and desktop/mobile viewports have no horizontal document overflow.
- Temporary UI screenshots were captured outside the repo at `/private/tmp/caniello-app-shell-desktop.png` and `/private/tmp/caniello-app-shell-mobile.png`.

Previous repository validation notes still relevant to the dirty worktree:

- `find spec -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort` completed and showed the flattened active workspace plus archived history.
- Confirmed no top-level `docs/` directory exists.
- `find spec/archive/flow-forge-history -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort` completed and showed archived requirements, stories, detailed features, old plans, release-readiness records, and lifecycle records.
- `rg "spec/(requirements|stories|release-readiness|lifecycle)" README.md AGENTS.md ROADMAP.md spec/README.md .codex/skills` returned no matches.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- `pnpm install` was run outside the sandbox because dependencies were missing and validation needed `turbo`.
- `pnpm lint` passed outside the sandbox after sandboxed attempts failed with `[ERROR] fetch failed`.
- `pnpm test` passed outside the sandbox after sandboxed attempts failed with `[ERROR] fetch failed`.
- `git diff --check` passed after adding `forge-publisher`.
- Ruby `Psych.safe_load` frontmatter sanity check passed for `.codex/skills/forge-publisher/SKILL.md`.
- Ruby `Psych.safe_load` metadata sanity check passed for every `.codex/skills/forge-*/agents/openai.yaml` file, including `$skill-name` default prompt references.
- `quick_validate.py .codex/skills/forge-publisher` could not run because the host Python lacks the `yaml` module.

## Known Gaps

- The app shell task intentionally does not add dashboard cards, onboarding, persistence, live search, notifications, AI, sharing behavior, section routes, or mobile app work.
- `pnpm test` emitted existing Vitest localStorage experimental warnings and Turbo output warnings; tests still passed.
- `node_modules/` was installed locally for validation and should remain ignored.
- `forge-publisher` has not been forward-tested on a real publish flow yet.
- Official skill quick validation is pending until `PyYAML` is available.
- No `pnpm build` or full `pnpm test:e2e` run was recorded for the app-shell task.

## Next Recommended Action

- Evaluate `spec/tasks/authenticated-app-shell-navigation.md`; if it passes, use `forge-publisher` when ready to commit, push, and open a draft PR.
- Next product task after this shell work: `spec/tasks/first-run-onboarding-skeleton.md`, because it builds on the new authenticated frame without adding dashboard cards or persistence.
